A fun conference, hackfest, etc. has been running for the last three days at UCL, called the [Citizen CyberScience Summit](http://cybersciencesummit.org/). Itâ€™s been a great chance for us to track what the largest fauna in this brave new world of crowd-sourcing (i.e. mass online data creation) are up to, such as [Zooniverse](http://www.zooniverse.org), [Mozilla Science Lab](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab) and [Crowdcrafting](http://crowdcrafting.org/), as well as noting the sheer diversity of other crowd-sourcing efforts, both large and small. We got a moment to present what we are developing with [MicroPasts](http://micropasts.org/) yesterday and the presentation (without script) is embedded below.
