Hello!

We’ve just launched the latest part of theMicroPasts project: a crowd-funding website. Have a [look and see if you can help](https://crowdfunded.micropasts.org).

Through this website, it is possible to raise up to £5,000 to fund archaeological or historical research projects that have been developed and will be undertaken collaboratively by professionals with institutional links (e.g. working in universities, museums, libraries, etc.) and any volunteer group offline or online. We welcome project proposals from any team,who can be based anywhere in the world. The only kind of activity that we do not fund is excavation.

If you have a project in need of funding, you can submit a proposal online. We will review it and, if it fits the requirements, you will be able to start your fund-raising campaign.

If you have an idea for a project, but don’t know a ‘professional’ archaeologist or historian to partner with, please do post your idea on the [MicroPasts community forum](http://community.micropasts.org) and we will try to help out.

Thank you!
