Hi all, last week we had the opportunity to introduce the MicroPasts project at two international conferences: the annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, in Austin, and the [Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology](http://caa2014.sciencesconf.org/) conference in Paris.

In Paris, we discussed our experience of developing the MicroPasts platforms so far, our aims, the challenges we have encountered and our evaluation plans and results until now. This talk was given as part of a very interesting session on [Community Archaeology and Technology](http://blog.soton.ac.uk/comarch/), which brought together lots of projects that are currently supporting peopleâ€™s participation in archaeological research and their engagment with heritage resources via digital technologies. The MicroPasts presentation is embedded below, we hope you will enjoy it!
