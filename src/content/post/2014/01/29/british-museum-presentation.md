The [MicroPasts team](https://blog.micropasts.org/people/) presented this morning on the progress of the project so far, as part of a [British Museum](http://www.britishmuseum.org) staff breakfast presentation. The presentation (without script) is shown below as an embedded pdf from Google Drive. It starts with detailing some new work on the Portable Antiquities Scheme site (visualisations by Tracemedia and mapping improvements) that BM staff may not have seen previously. Then it moves onto discuss the aims and objectives of the three strands of the MicroPasts project.
