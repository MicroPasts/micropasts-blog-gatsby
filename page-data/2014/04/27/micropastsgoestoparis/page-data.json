This talk was given as part of a very interesting session on <a href=\"http://blog.soton.ac.uk/comarch/\">Community Archaeology and Technology</a>, which brought together lots of projects that are currently supporting people’s participation in archaeological research and their engagment with heritage resources via digital technologies.
