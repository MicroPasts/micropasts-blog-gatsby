Although the simplicity of Thomsen’s scheme has been questioned in the intervening years, and other important divisions have been recognised, it remains relevant, and the Bronze Age has a distinct character of its own. The date and character of the Bronze Age do, however, differ across Europe, with communications and mobility between regions and countries also changing through time.</p>\n<p>In Britain, the Bronze Age is a period used by archaeologist to refer to the centuries from 2500 to 800 BC. At the start of the period (from 2500 to 2200 BC) only gold and copper were being used, but from 2200 BC bronze was created by mixing (alloying) tin and copper. In the initial period (around 2200-2000 BC), Irish copper and Cornish tin were used in bronze production. The sources of copper then changed as new mines (especially in Wales) were exploited and Continental metal was brought into Britain. The first iron objects appear from around 1000 BC, and the Iron Age is said to begin around 800 BC (again, this is more a convenient academic label, rather than an abrupt historical ). The Bronze Age chronologies are notoriously complex, but here is a table summarising the main developments by period:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 2000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cb196e94f5ef1f92ebb31e77b1679d29/dd841/BA-Chronology-Chart-1.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 142.8%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/cb196e94f5ef1f92ebb31e77b1679d29/4be29/BA-Chronology-Chart-1.webp 500w,\n/static/cb196e94f5ef1f92ebb31e77b1679d29/03f31/BA-Chronology-Chart-1.webp 1000w,\n/static/cb196e94f5ef1f92ebb31e77b1679d29/b1218/BA-Chronology-Chart-1.webp 2000w,\n/static/cb196e94f5ef1f92ebb31e77b1679d29/9d290/BA-Chronology-Chart-1.webp 2455w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/cb196e94f5ef1f92ebb31e77b1679d29/d1f95/BA-Chronology-Chart-1.jpg 500w,\n/static/cb196e94f5ef1f92ebb31e77b1679d29/dbdff/BA-Chronology-Chart-1.jpg 1000w,\n/static/cb196e94f5ef1f92ebb31e77b1679d29/109c0/BA-Chronology-Chart-1.jpg 2000w,\n/static/cb196e94f5ef1f92ebb31e77b1679d29/dd841/BA-Chronology-Chart-1.jpg 2455w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/cb196e94f5ef1f92ebb31e77b1679d29/109c0/BA-Chronology-Chart-1.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Major chronological periods of the British Bronze Age (largely based on Needham 1996; see also Roberts 2008 &amp; Roberts, Uckelmann, &amp; Brandherm 2013)\"\n            title=\"Major chronological periods of the British Bronze Age (largely based on Needham 1996; see also Roberts 2008 &amp; Roberts, Uckelmann, &amp; Brandherm 2013)\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Major chronological periods of the British Bronze Age (largely based on Needham 1996; see also Roberts 2008 &amp; Roberts, Uckelmann, &amp; Brandherm 2013)</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>From around 1500 BC, the evidence for the contexts in which we find metal objects changes from burials to ‘hoard’ deposits. Hoards, defined loosely as two or more objects deposited together, that are often treated in special and unusual ways prior to deposition (for instance swords may be intentionally bent and ornaments folded and broken up). This hoarding practice may sometimes have had a religious or ritual significance, a point also suggested by the location of the deposits in unusual and special places (e.g. rivers, bogs and natural features). Indeed, although opinions vary, current thinking tends to suggest that hoards were ‘gifts for the Gods’ (akin to pennies thrown into wells with the expectation of a granted wish), rather than purely ‘rubbish’ or items stored for safe keeping.</p>\n<p>Communities also made use of ceramics throughout the period, expressing identities through particular styles. These were often deemed important enough to deposit with the dead, particularly during the period between 2500 to 1500 BC (e.g. Beakers, Food Vessels and Collared Urns). Although the survival of organics from this period is rare, there are sufficient examples to know that communities were highly skilled at working these materials as well.</p>\n<p>Most of the archaeological evidence for the earlier part of the period (c.2500 to 1500 BC) comes from funerary evidence and monuments and there is little evidence for permanent settlements of any size or scale. This may suggest that communities and populations were still relatively small-scale by comparison with later periods. Towards the end of the Bronze Age (from 1500 to 800 BC) there is, however, greater evidence for roundhouses and field systems, particularly in Southern England.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c8e7b8da1b073d5594a5edd3d54a3c65/dbdff/BM-Arreton-Hoard-at-Franks.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.8%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/c8e7b8da1b073d5594a5edd3d54a3c65/4be29/BM-Arreton-Hoard-at-Franks.webp 500w,\n/static/c8e7b8da1b073d5594a5edd3d54a3c65/03f31/BM-Arreton-Hoard-at-Franks.webp 1000w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/c8e7b8da1b073d5594a5edd3d54a3c65/d1f95/BM-Arreton-Hoard-at-Franks.jpg 500w,\n/static/c8e7b8da1b073d5594a5edd3d54a3c65/dbdff/BM-Arreton-Hoard-at-Franks.jpg 1000w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/c8e7b8da1b073d5594a5edd3d54a3c65/dbdff/BM-Arreton-Hoard-at-Franks.jpg\"\n            alt=\"The Arreton hoard from the Isle of Wight includes flanged axes and spearheads (socketed and tanged types).\"\n            title=\"The Arreton hoard from the Isle of Wight includes flanged axes and spearheads (socketed and tanged types).\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">The Arreton hoard from the Isle of Wight includes flanged axes and spearheads (socketed and tanged types).</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>If you are interested in reading more about later prehistoric Britain these resources might help to get you started:</p>\n<h2>Published resources</h2>\n<h3>Books &#x26; articles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cowie, T. 1988. <em>Magic Metal.
