How can <em>value</em> be understood in this context? Value <em>for whom</em>?</p>\n<p>Here is some initial thinking…</p>\n<p>I am interested in studying the <em>value</em> resulting from <em>experiences</em> of engaging with crowd-sourcing through <em>time,</em> for different <em>community</em> members. The latter can potentially range from ‘professionals’ working in research institutions, the GLAM or private sector, to amateurs and any interested members of the public. This community focussed perspective is better suited for the aims of our project and allows combining into a coherent whole approaches that are traditionally distinguished as being people or institution-centred.</p>\n<p>A number of valuable papers and reports have addressed issues related to the evaluation of crowd-sourcing in both the science and cultural heritage sectors. However, none, to my knowledge, has explicitly tried to examine how contributor experiences change through time together with their perceived and real value. This is what this project hopes to achieve.</p>\n<p>To ‘capture’ <em>value,</em> I am looking to examine the following aspects, both individually and in their interrelation, for the entire duration of <a href=\"https://blog.micropasts.org/about-the-project/\" title=\"Crowd and Community-fuelled Archaeological Research\">Crowd and Community-fuelled Archaeological Research</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the <em>social</em> <em>motivations</em> for engaging with crowd-sourcing, where engagement is provisionally defined as accessing and contributing to the crowd-sourcing platform with content and/or a donation. Motivations for participating in crowd-sourcing are successfully analysed and reviewed in relevant literature (e.g. Raddick <em>et al.</em> 2009, Dunn &#x26; Hedges 2012, Ridge 2013), but not with attention devoted to understand, in depth, how they evolve as contributors’ engagement progresses, nor in relation to archaeology in particular.</li>\n<li>the <em>dynamics of community building</em> that lead contributors to seek satisfaction for their social motivations (e.g. helping, learning, contributing knowledge) by joining the crowd-sourcing community. More specifically, here it will be useful to explain the role played by the following: socio-demographic characteristics; family and friendship ties; cultural practices; the fact of belonging to already established communities of interest; contributors’ understanding of and interest in archaeology and history; the kinds of tasks that are proposed on the platform, the way in which engagement is structured and how the online space is organised.</li>\n<li>the nature of the <em>engagement</em> <em>experience</em>: for example, whether it is anonymous or ‘authored’, a one-off try or an effort sustained through time, whether it involves exchanges of ideas with fellow members of the community or not, and how the factors mentioned under point 2. have an impact on the nature of engagement experiences.</li>\n<li>the <em>value</em> resulting from engagement experiences directly or indirectly. Particularly, I would like to explore what <em>cultural</em> and <em>economic</em> resources have been mobilised by experiences of engagement and the value that contributors attribute to those experiences for their own sake. What knowledge is exchanged within crowdsourcing communities? What donations have been made to projects proposed for crowd-funding? How are ‘flow’ experiences triggered?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In one of my next posts, I will start discussing a methodology suitable for applying this framework, and assess the value of crowd-sourcing for community engagement with archaeology.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>Chiara</p>","id":"49ff7a84-a09c-5c48-8350-ec98131f2dfc","timeToRead":2,"wordCount":{"words":514},"frontmatter":{"permalink":"/2013/11/14/communities-engagement-experiences-and-value","date":"November 14, 2013","title":"Communities, engagement experiences and value","author":["Chiara Bonacchi"],"tag":["Communities","community building","crowd-sourcing","engagement experiences","MicroPasts","social motivations","value"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013/11/14/communities-engagement-experiences-and-value","id":"49ff7a84-a09c-5c48-8350-ec98131f2dfc"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1547238275","3649515864"],"slicesMap":{}}
