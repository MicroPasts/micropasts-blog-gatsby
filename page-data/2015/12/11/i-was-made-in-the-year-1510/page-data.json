This time, we will be working towards the production of a 3D model of the <em>Mary Rose</em> bell, one of the most iconic items to have been raised from the wreck site.</p>\n<p>The bell recovered from the <em>Mary Rose</em> was one of the last items to be recovered from the wreck site (it was found under the ship below the starboard side). It was also the last item to be placed into the new Mary Rose Museum. At the Museum’s media launch in May 2013, the bell was processed into the museum by the ship’s company from the Navy’s latest Type 45 warship, HMS <em>Duncan.</em></p>\n<p>The bell was cast in bronze and metallurgy results showed it was made from copper (82%), tin (15%) and lead (1.7%). The Flemish inscription at the top reads ‘Ic ben ghegoten int yaer MCCCCCX’ which translates as ‘I was made in the year 1510’, the year that the <em>Mary Rose</em> was commissioned.</p>\n<p>On board ships, the bell was used to signal the time, to mark the change of the watch and as a warning, particularly to other ships in fog.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We&#39;re working with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MicroPasts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Micropasts</a> to turn our ship&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bell?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bell</a> into a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/3dModel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#3dModel</a> - and you can help! <a href=\"https://t.co/W1YPtYzjvO\">https://t.co/W1YPtYzjvO</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MJA0Cqr8iS\">pic.twitter.com/MJA0Cqr8iS</a></p>&mdash; The Mary Rose (@MaryRoseMuseum) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaryRoseMuseum/status/674892263718305792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 10, 2015</a></blockquote>","id":"2d884708-b31a-5b28-91c1-7c0e8d3d9073","timeToRead":1,"wordCount":{"words":198},"excerpt":"The Mary Rose Trust are very…","frontmatter":{"permalink":"/2015/12/11/i-was-made-in-the-year-1510","date":"December 11, 2015","title":"‘I was made in the year 1510’","author":["The Mary Rose Trust"],"tag":["Research","crowd-sourcing","3D modelling","archaeology","archaeological research","maritime archaeology","Mary Rose"],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgABAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAQUGB//EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB7bWVeNzepMtUEYl0D//EABsQAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDAQQABRAR/9oACAEBAAEFAimBGhci1zctaqrrGNCz5hgJwFdIzn//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEDAQE/AR//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIP/aAAgBAgEBPwFj/8QAIBAAAgEEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRABAiQSEDBCMxov/aAAgBAQAGPwIk+hzT6YH51bxCVPDmJgUo7bMschGrZCalemoNv//EABwQAQEAAwADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAERABAhQVFhsf/aAAgBAQABPyFU4VPowoynCS11oMqlJSGXVAAc67XxoaJD6n5gMI6Ov//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQH8hC/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREg/9oACAEDAQE/EApj/8QAFxEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAQEf/aAAgBAgEBPxBIhMv/xAAeEAEAAgIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhQTFRYXGBkf/aAAgBAQABPxAdTfRBa/Irr1v2KZdpzAHtGjxCSWjgXC69xWm2jEcCgF5jZwtRN6FDc8i464AI2Jw5Zc//2Q=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a0d014306852da7749964ca7f6a66119/04add/Bell1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a0d014306852da7749964ca7f6a66119/e07d1/Bell1.jpg 150w,\n/static/a0d014306852da7749964ca7f6a66119/05177/Bell1.jpg 300w,\n/static/a0d014306852da7749964ca7f6a66119/04add/Bell1.jpg 600w,\n/static/a0d014306852da7749964ca7f6a66119/3d747/Bell1.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a0d014306852da7749964ca7f6a66119/628fd/Bell1.webp 150w,\n/static/a0d014306852da7749964ca7f6a66119/8aaca/Bell1.webp 300w,\n/static/a0d014306852da7749964ca7f6a66119/ec39e/Bell1.webp 600w,\n/static/a0d014306852da7749964ca7f6a66119/49a25/Bell1.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":600}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2015/12/11/i-was-made-in-the-year-1510","id":"2d884708-b31a-5b28-91c1-7c0e8d3d9073"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","4037206124"],"slicesMap":{}}
